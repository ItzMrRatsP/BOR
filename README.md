# What are variables?
As the name suggest "vary" and "able" means they can be anything, Variables allow you to reuse something again and again in multiple parts of your script, So for example if i have a Id (unique identifier) in my code, I need to save it somewhere so i can reuse it again, This is where variable come in clutch!
