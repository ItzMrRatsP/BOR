# What is OOP? [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects. Objects can contain data (called fields, attributes or properties) and have actions they can perform (called procedures or methods and implemented in code). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.
